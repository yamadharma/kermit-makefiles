# Type of generation.

# pdf   : use pdflatex to create a PDF document

# Specify the style that must be used by makeindex.
# Valid values are:
#    <filename>      if a filename was specified, AutoLaTeX assumes that it is the .ist file;
#    @system         AutoLaTeX uses the system default .ist file (in AutoLaTeX distribution);
#    @detect         AutoLaTeX will tries to find a .ist file in the project's directory. If
#                    none was found, AutoLaTeX will not pass a style to makeindex;
#    @none           AutoLaTeX assumes that no .ist file must be passed to makeindex;
#    <empty>         AutoLaTeX assumes that no .ist file must be passed to makeindex.
#    @detect@system  If @detect failed, assumes @system
