Description: LaTeX large project compiling helper
 AutoLaTeX is a tool for managing small to large sized LaTeX projects.
 The typical AutoLaTeX input file is simply a series of variable definitions
 in a Makefile for the project. This Makefile was automatically generated by
 a provided Perl script. The user can easily perform all required steps to
 do such tasks as: preview the document, or produce a PDF file. AutoLaTeX will
 keep track of files that have changed and how to run the various programs
 that are needed to produce the output. One of the best feature of AutoLaTeX
 is to provide translation rules to automatically generate the figures which
 will be included into the PDF.
 .
 This is a dummy package that permits to install the autolatex packages
 that are commonly used.
